As for the branches, it's one feature per branch. So if it all ends up in main, we continue to add one feature per branch into main.

Okay, thank you for explaining that. I'll have to look into it more, and we'll need to decide how we're organizing code soon.

we merged Luke's branch with develop, so now everyone can create their own branch for their feature and build off what he started. for now we can keep everything in main.py, if we need to separate something later we can do that.

Sounds good
LaurynG — Yesterday at 1:45 PM
Don't forget peer reviews are due tomorrow. And anyone is welcome to come to the mac lab tomorrow 11-12 so we can get everyone set up with the project and git

Git is back up
LaurynG — 1:56 PM
figured out that "git reset --hard origin/develop" gets rid of your current untracked changes and makes your files match exactly whats currently on git. I used that so I was able to pull Luke's and branch. * Ideally you want to branch before making any changes to files/code at all because if you don't it makes it hard to commit/save your changes. Branch basically just says "hey -> here i made some changes"
but that command is destructive and can get rid of commits I just used that because I was trying to get started and I haven't  added anything yet for it to get rid of
LaurynG — 3:47 PM
@Luke Leopold I think the reason u needed someone to approve your request was because you were merging with developed. We are supposed to stay on the feature branch until the feature is done and merge to developed when done with the feature. Putting something back on the developed branch is our main, if you would have pushed it to the “origin” instead you wouldn’t have needed approval from anyone.
@Notavirus.exe When pushing do not push onto developed until completely done with the feature (done with testing). To push onto the feature branch to update partial changes with the feature just push to “origin”. He’s a list of command lines to help you guys. Verified with Hobbs this is what is supposed to be done.

LaurynG — 3:53 PM
In the add I am just saying putting the file names is optional you don’t need brackets or “opt” tho
Luke Leopold

 — 3:54 PM
I merged with develop so you guys had a starting point with main. I wasn't sure how far along you guys were over the weekend
LaurynG — 3:54 PM
Yeah but we aren’t supposed to do that if you push to your branch we can still see it
I just was in Hobbs office and he said communicate this with the group!
TheLegend27 — 3:56 PM
We just talked to Hobbs bro we’re not supposed to touch that branch unless the feature is done and told us to let everyone know not to do that any more
Luke Leopold

 — 3:56 PM
Ok then I'll see if I can rollback develop
LaurynG — 4:03 PM
You don’t need to rollback it’s okay. Just for moving forward everyone needs to be on the same page. Hobbs said today we should have a tiny bit of time at the end so I can let everyone know then. But he said bc of the quiz we get more group time wed.
! And everyone just be aware when you update your code it has Lukes method in which isn’t fully finished
Keller E — 4:06 PM
got it, i made a new branch of develop to start with the run scheduler part, as part of it i added the test config brooks sent to the files
Luke Leopold

 — 4:06 PM
It adds faculty just fine. It just needs a config file. All it doesn't do is check for duplicates and it doesn't have unit tests
Hailey H

 — 5:20 PM
We still need to test it, as we do not know this for sure. We agreed as a group that finished means that it fully passes all tests that we have. Once we test it and check for duplicates, then we can mark it as done
Hailey H

 — 6:44 PM
@Client Can you hop in a meeting room to help Ashton setup the scheduler?
